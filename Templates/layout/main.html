                Bookshop.org began as an idea to help support bookstores and their communities 
                as more and more people are buying their books online. 
                We saw an opportunity to create an alternative to Amazon 
                for socially-conscious online shoppers. Amazon sells over 60% of all books 
                in the US and is growing. That shift threatens the future 
                of bookstores and will hurt readers, authors, 
                and publishers who rely on a diverse, healthy ecosystem f
                or books. We had a better idea — give readers the convenience of online 
                shopping while supporting independent bookstores at the same time.

                We launched in January of 2020, with just 88 bookstore partners and a team of four 
                passionate book people As the COVID-19 pandemic surged, our growing platform helped our community of 
                independent booksellers survive shutdowns. That spring, traffic to Bookshop.org h
                it 1 million users in a single day. By the end of 2020 we had grown to over 1,000 
                bookstores and distributed over ten million dollars in profits. Bookshop.org has 
                since expanded internationally, launching in the UK and Spain.78% of our customers said 
                they regularly bought books from Amazon before they made the switch.
